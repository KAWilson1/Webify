# Webify
Webify is a tool that transforms your plain-text notes into a stylized HTML file.

## Why did I make Webify?
During my time in university, I found that taking neat and tidy notes took so long that I'd fall behind what the lecturer was teaching. I created Webify which allowed me to take notes in a quick and simple format, which I could later run through Webify to make reviewing easier by formatting and coloring the notes.

## Get started
Webify has no dependencies, so no pip installs are required.

Type your notes (format shown below) into notes.txt and run webify.py.

Your stylized html file will be called webified.html.

## Note taking format (Example in notes.txt)
The title block can have any number of lines displayed within.

The title block must be followed with an empty line.

There cannot be blank lines anywhere else in the document.


The following blocks must take the following structure (Each "-" represents one tab)

Header 1

-Detail 1

--Subdetail 1

--Subdetail 2

-Detail 2
